scratch-spring-boot-servlet
==============

This project just contains a simple Spring Boot `Servlet` class in the root scratch package. If this project is
added as a dependency to another scratch project the `Servlet` class can be imported to a configuration class to
automatically set up all the default Spring Boot configuration for a web application.
